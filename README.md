# Flight Price Predictor

A full-stack machine learning project that predicts flight ticket prices based on user inputs such as airline, route, travel class, duration, and days left before departure.

This project is built with:
- **FastAPI**: for serving the ML model as a REST API
- **Streamlit**: for a user-friendly frontend interface
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: for containerization and easy deployment

---

## Features

- Predict flight ticket prices using a trained RandomForest model
- REST API with validation using Pydantic and FastAPI
- Streamlit-based UI for easy user interaction
- Fully containerized using Docker Compose
- Auto-generated API documentation (Swagger UI)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flight-price-predictor.git
cd flight-price-predictor
```

### 2. Run the App with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build and launch both the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend.
